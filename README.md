## IC Hello World
DoCSoc's first virtual hackathon for students at Imperial College London ran in place of IC Hack 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions on March 27-28th.
We built a social Android App, using Java, with proximity-based volume and Spotify API integration.


We entered the 'Most Innovative Use of the Web' category, sponsored by Netcraft, where we finished runner-up
